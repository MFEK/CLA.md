## Status of Contributions made before this Agreement.

This Agreement only became mandatory for Contributors for Contributions made on and after 7<sup>th</sup> November 2022. Instituting this agreement does nothing to subtract from the MFEK Foundation's legitimate claims to its copyrights and other intellectual property rights over Contributions made before this Agreement's institution, be they established by the common law principle of “work done on commission for a client is owned by the client unless a contract states otherwise” or the common sense principle that “by submitting work to a Foundation with goals such as the MFEK Foundation's, the Contributor knew that their work would be irrevocably done in the public interest”, or any other legal principle whatsoever, be they principles as yet well established or principles hereto established.

### Reason for institution of this Agreement.

_No crisis precipitated this agreement._ Chairman Brennan contributed to the JPEG XL project, noted it had one of these, thought it was a good idea, then copied it verbatim.
