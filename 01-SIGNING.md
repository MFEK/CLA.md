## Signing the MFEK CLA.
1. You may sign the MFEK CLA by opening a GitHub issue against the repository [MFEK/CLA.md](https://github.com/MFEK/CLA.md). Paste the entirety of the agreement (for your convenience provided in [`CLA.txt`](CLA.txt)), then under it, write:

    > I, [Name McNameface], agree to the MFEK CLA above. I understand that all electronic signatures are the legal equivalent of my manual/handwritten signature and I consent to be legally bound to this agreement. ☙

    Replacing «Name McNameface» with your full legal name.

2. You may also sign the MFEK CLA by mailing a physical letter to the chairperson, currently Fredrick R. Brennan (@ctrlcctrlv). Contact him via email for a mailing address. _This method may be refused._
